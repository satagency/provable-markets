# Aurora Platform: Strategic Design Vision
*VP of Design Strategic Brief for Executive Leadership*

## Executive Summary

Aurora needs unified workflows that drive revenue and retention. Our current interface fragments user tasks and limits trading volumes. Three strategic priorities will transform Aurora into the leading securities lending platform.

**Bottom Line:** Integrated design drives measurable business outcomes—higher user engagement, increased trading volumes, and competitive differentiation.

## Strategic Priorities

### 1. Revenue-Driving Features
**Strategy Builder & Advanced Matching** - Missing functionality prevents sophisticated trading strategies, directly impacting volumes and fees.

**Bulk Order Management** - Institutional users need portfolio-scale operations. Without this, they use external tools and reduce platform dependency.

### 2. Workflow Efficiency  
**Smart Data Tables** - All tables become filterable, sortable, and customizable. Users save preferred views. This reduces daily friction and increases session time.

**Connected Components** - Click a position, see related orders. Select a counterparty, filter all data. Connected workflows eliminate context switching.

### 3. Design System Evolution
**From Stock Components to Custom Platform** - Current Material Design components lack sophistication and platform identity. We're building a fluid, systematic design foundation.

- **Current Limitation**: Stock Material Design components lack sophistication
- **Strategic Solution**: Custom design system with fluid, systematic approach  
- **Business Impact**: Professional interfaces signal platform maturity to institutional users
- **Immediate Value**: Enhanced visual design drives user confidence and competitive differentiation

### 3. User Experience Excellence
**Progressive Discovery** - Transform complex selections into simple conversations. Type a name, see relevant options. This pattern scales across order creation, agreements, and all data selection.

**Agreement Streamlining** - Replace manual entry with templates and smart defaults. When 90% of terms are identical, bulk operations become essential.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Strategy Builder**: Core matching interface
  - [AURORA-4212](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4212)
- **Progressive Discovery**: Smart selection across all workflows
  - [Demo](https://project-financial-agreements-management-dashboard-676.magicpatterns.app/) | [Specs](https://www.notion.so/provablelabs/Progressive-Agreement-Discovery-UX-Statements-25c4999406d580788d8afa7edd0f8ecf)
  - **Impact**: Users type naturally instead of memorizing codes. Reduces training time, eliminates errors, works everywhere we have complex data selection.
- **Bulk Order Tools**: Multi-order rate updates
  - [AURORA-4734](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4734)
- **Agreement Templates**: Bulk creation with smart defaults
  - [PM-430](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/PM-430) | [AURORA-4339](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4339)

### Phase 2: Intelligence  
- **Advanced Tables**: Saved views and custom filtering
  - [AURORA-3739](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-3739) | [AURORA-3740](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-3740) | [AURORA-4683](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4683) | [AURORA-4462](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4462)
- **Connected Workflows**: Cross-screen data integration
  - [AURORA-3769](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-3769)
- **Enhanced Orderbook**: Consolidated navigation and market intelligence

### Phase 3: Optimization
- **Trade Booking**: Enhanced manual workflows
  - [AURORA-4644](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4644)
- **System Features**: Notifications, interface improvements
  - [AURORA-4096](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4096) | [AURORA-4697](https://provablelabs.atlassian.net/browse/AURORA-4697)
- **Vue3 Migration**: Technical debt resolution

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in daily active workflows
- **Revenue Impact**: 25% improvement in order volume per user  
- **Efficiency**: 30% reduction in workflow-related support tickets
- **Competitive Position**: Measurable UX advantage over existing platforms

## Business Impact

**Revenue Protection**: Design gaps risk user migration. Enhanced workflows directly correlate to volume retention and growth.

**Market Differentiation**: Purpose-built securities lending interfaces outperform adapted trading tools. Our domain expertise becomes operationally superior.

**Operational Efficiency**: Integrated workflows reduce errors, accelerate tasks, and drive user satisfaction while reducing internal costs.

## Strategic Roadmap Philosophy

**From Feature Lists to Outcome Focus**: Traditional roadmaps list features without clear business rationale. Users don't care about "enhanced tables"—they care about completing tasks faster. Our roadmap targets specific outcomes: reduce order entry time, eliminate training bottlenecks, increase daily trading volumes.

**Measurable Business Results**: Each initiative connects directly to revenue, efficiency, or competitive advantage. Progressive Discovery isn't about "better UX"—it's about reducing user onboarding from weeks to days. Bulk operations aren't convenience features—they're essential for institutional scale.

**User-Centric Metrics**: Success means users accomplish more with less effort. We measure task completion time, error reduction, and workflow adoption—not feature delivery dates.
